## Dispense of medication that was prescribed to take if needed, but was not taken

This example shows a prescription that is made by VOS and to take only if needed and the pharmacist dispenses it. 
Then it is reported that the medication was not taken at all.

* After a GP visit, the patient Pia Peters is prescribed Ciprofloxacine 500 mg cp since the patient will travel to southeast Asia. The prescription is marked as "taken if discomfort or diarrhea"
* After reaching the pharmacy, Ciproxine is dispensed facing that prescription.
* After the patient arrives from the travel, she tells the GP that she ended up not taking the medication because she had no problems.
* This should result in a medication summary that can group treatment lines, enabling the visualization of the prescription and related dispenses next to each other.
