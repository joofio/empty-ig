This example shows a prescription that is made by VOS and the pharmacist refuses to dispense the medication due to interaction with previous medication.


* After a GP visit, the patient Pia Peters (75 years) is prescribed ibuprofen 400 mg cp (TID) for headaches.
* The pharmacist, after a conversation with the patient, got to know that he was doing Tritace (ramipril) 10 mg for hypertension.
